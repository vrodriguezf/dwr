  abstract = {Mission planning for collaborative Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS:s)
	is a complex topic which involves trade-offs between the degree of
	centralization or decentralization required, the degree of abstraction
	in which plans are generated, and the degree to which such plans
	are distributed among participating UAS:s. In realistic environments
	such as those found in natural and man-made catastrophes where emergency
	services personnel are involved, a certain degree of centralization
	and abstraction is necessary in order for those in charge to understand
	and eventually sign off on potential plans. It is also quite often
	the case that unconstrained distribution of actions is inconsistent
	with the loosely coupled interactions and dependencies which arise
	between collaborating systems. In this article, we present a new
	planning algorithm for collaborative UAS:s based on combining ideas
	from forward chaining planning with partial-order planning leading
	to a new hybrid partial order forward-chaining (POFC) framework which
	meets the requirements on centralization, abstraction and distribution
	we find in realistic emergency services settings.},

	It is about single-item or small batch production where scarce resources
	have to be met when scheduling dependent activities over time. Because
	of high complexity of the problem uninformed search strategies cannot
	solve the problem optimally. This paper proposes a new evolutionary
	approach to resource constrained project scheduling problem. Hybrid
	genetic algorithm (GA)-constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) has
	been applied to solve resource constrained project scheduling (RCPS).
	GA's task is to find the best schedule. Discussed approach has used
	CSP in order to overcome the existing inconsistencies in activities
	precedence and resources conflicts. A full state CSP with min-conflict
	heuristic has been used for solving precedence conflicts. And a simple
	iterative CSP is used to resolve the resource conflicts.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unmanned aircraft
	systems (UAS) with advanced onboard autonomous capabilities. This
	paper describes the current state of the art in autonomous rotorcraft
	UAS (RUAS) and provides a detailed literature review of the last
	two decades of active research on RUAS. Three functional technology
	areas are identified as the core components of an autonomous RUAS.
	Guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) have received much attention
	from the research community, and have dominated the UAS literature
	from the nineties until now. This paper first presents the main research
	groups involved in the development of GNC systems for RUAS. Then
	it describes the development of a framework that provides standard
	definitions and metrics characterizing and measuring the autonomy
	level of a RUAS using GNC aspects. This framework is intended to
	facilitate the understanding and the organization of this survey
	paper, but it can also serve as a common reference for the UAS community.
	The main objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey
	of RUAS research that captures all seminal works and milestones in
	each GNC area, with a particular focus on practical methods and technologies
	that have been demonstrated in flight tests. These algorithms and
	systems have been classified into different categories and classes
	based on the autonomy level they provide and the algorithmic approach
	used. Finally, the paper discusses the RUAS literature in general
	and highlights challenges that need to be addressed in developing
	autonomous systems for unmanned rotorcraft. Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

	A scenario is examined, where multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs)
	must perform one or more tasks on a set of geographically dispersed
	targets in the presence of no-fly zones. Strict inter-task timing
	constraints apply, which have been chosen by BAE Systems' Military
	Air & Information (MAI) business to reflect current UAV usage. The
	optimal assignment of these tasks requires cooperation amongst the
	vehicles in order to generate a plan that is efficient, with respect
	to overall mission duration and satisfies all problem constraints.
	A number of previous papers have compared the benefits of employing
	numerous optimisation algorithms to this class of problem. Recently,
	auction techniques have been investigated for coordination of multiple
	autonomous assets and this paper compares two auctioning algorithms,
	a meta-heuristic algorithm and a mathematical programming approach
	for solving such constrained task assignment problems.},

  abstract = {Background: The principles of protein folding and evolution pose problems
	of very high inherent complexity. Often these problems are tackled
	using simplified protein models, e.g. lattice proteins. The CPSP-tools
	package provides programs to solve exactly and completely the problems
	typical of studies using 3D lattice protein models. Among the tasks
	addressed are the prediction of (all) globally optimal and/or suboptimal
	structures as well as sequence design and neutral network exploration.
	Results: In contrast to stochastic approaches, which are not capable
	of answering many fundamental questions, our methods are based on
	fast, non-heuristic techniques. The resulting tools are designed
	for high-throughput studies of 3D-lattice proteins utilizing the
	Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model. The source bundle is freely available
	at http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/sw/cpsp/
	
	Conclusions: The CPSP-tools package is the first set of exact and
	complete methods for extensive, high-throughput studies of non-restricted
	3D-lattice protein models. In particular, our package deals with
	cubic and face centered cubic (FCC) lattices.},

	satisfying the reconnaissance resolution demands of the targets,

	formulation is presented for the problem, taking the targets reconnaissance

	are always ignored in previous approaches. Then a CA based approach
	is put forward to resolve the problem. Our GA implementation uses

	novel evolutionary operators, including a subsequence crossover operator
	and a forward insertion mutation operator. Finally the simulation
