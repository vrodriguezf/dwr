\lhead{Appendix A. \emph{Drone Watch And Rescue Dataset}}

This appendix shows the entire dataset used to save the data from a simulation executed by the simulator \textit{Drone Watch And Rescue}. The Data Base Management System used to store this dataset is \emph{MongoDB}, and hence the data is organized into collections.
